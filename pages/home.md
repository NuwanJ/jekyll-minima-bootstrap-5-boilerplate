# Jekyll Minima - Bootstrap 5

It's very easy to make some words **bold** and other words *italic* with Markdown. You can even [link to Google!](http://google.com)

# Heading 1
## Heading 2
### Heading 3
#### Heading 4
##### Heading 5
###### Heading 6



Sometimes you want numbered lists:
1. One
2. Two
3. Three

Sometimes you want bullet points:
* Start a line with a star
* Profit!

Alternatively,
- Dashes work just as well
- And if you have sub points, put two spaces before the dash or star:
  - Like this
  - And this

If you'd like to quote someone, use the > character before the line:
> Coffee. The finest organic suspension ever devised... I beat the Borg with it.
> - Captain Janeway

I think you should use an
`<addr>` element here instead.
